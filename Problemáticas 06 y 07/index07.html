                    In the four-minute video below, <strong>Brian Johnson</strong> tells the "official
                    version" of the answer to the question he gets asked more than any other: "How did you
                    come to join <strong>AC/DC</strong>?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last month, <strong>AC/DC</strong> guitarist <strong>Angus Young</strong> told
                    <strong>95.5 KLOS's "New & Approved"</strong> series about how late <strong>AC/DC</strong>
                    singer <strong>Bon Scott</strong> first met <strong>Johnson</strong> in the early 1970s.
                    "<strong>Bon</strong> had been in a band that had toured in Britain, and they were opening
                    for the band <strong>Brian</strong> was in, which was a band called <strong>GEORDIE</strong>"
                    Angus said. "Anyhow, they were gigging away, and as <strong>Bon</strong> told the story,
                    he was saying he was listening to <strong>GEORDIE</strong> performing and listening to
                    <strong>Brian</strong>, and then he heard this screaming. He said it sounded great — he
                    said it sounded like <strong>Little Richard</strong> was on the stage. He said this guy
                    [was] howling and yelling. And then he said then he saw the guy on the floor.
                    <strong>Bon</strong> thought it was great — it was the best act he had seen, and a singer,
                    in a long time. But what he didn't know, afterwards he found out, <strong>Brian</strong>
                    had an attack of appendicitis. But <strong>Bon</strong> thought it was part of the act.
                    He thought, 'This guy is incredible.', 'And he was still hittin' these high notes.'"
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Brian</strong> previously spoke about crossing paths with <strong>Bon</strong>
                    in a 2011 interview with <strong>New York Post.</strong> He said: "I met <strong>Bon</strong>
                    in 1973 or 1974. His band was supporting my band, <strong>GEORDIE.</strong>
                    I had a terrible case of appendicitis and I went down on my side, kicking and going, 'Ooh!'
                    But I kept on singing. Apparently, he told the boys when he joined <strong>AC/DC</strong>
                    'I saw this guy <strong>Brian Johnson</strong> sing, and he was great.
                    He was on the floor, kicking and screaming — what an act!' Of course, it wasn't an act.
                    I was really ill."
                </p>
                <p>
                    On July 25, 1980, <strong>AC/DC</strong> released <strong>"Back in Black"</strong>
                    in the U.S., followed by the album's U.K. release on July 31. It was the band's first
                    album without <strong>Scott</strong>, who had died a few months earlier after passing
                    out and choking on his own vomit following a long night of drinking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The group quickly decided to press on and hired <strong>Johnson</strong> from the band
                    <strong>GEORDIE</strong> to take over on vocals, and they headed to the Bahamas for about
                    six weeks to do the album. <strong>AC/DC</strong> had made some serious headway in America
                    before Scott's death, but no one knew how <strong>"Back In Black"</strong> would be received.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>"Back in Black"</strong>first went platinum in October 1980. The <strong>RIAA</strong>
                    lists <strong>"Back in Black"</strong> as the fourth biggest-selling album of all time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>"Back In Black"</strong> included the singles <strong>"You Shook Me All Night Long"</strong>
                    which peaked at No. 35 on the Billboard Hot 100, and <strong>"Back In Black"</strong>, which peaked at No. 37.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite its massive success, it never got higher than No. 4 on the album charts.
                    The band's next album, <strong>"For Those About To Rock"</strong>, reached No. 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>"Back In Black"</strong> produced by <strong>Robert "Mutt" Lange, who went on to
                        produce DEF LEPPARD, FOREIGNER,THE CARS, and BRYAN ADAMS.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2012, <strong>"Back In Black"</strong> was added to The
                    <strong>Recording Academy</strong>'s legendary <strong>Grammy Hall Of Fame</strong> collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last year, <strong>AC/DC</strong> launched a
                    <a href="https://store.acdc.com/dept/back-in-black-40th-anniversary">
                        range of new merchandise
                    </a>
                    to celebrate the 40th anniversary of <strong>"Back In Black".</strong>
